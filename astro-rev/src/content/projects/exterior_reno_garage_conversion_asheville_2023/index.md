description: "We transformed an old garage door opening into a beautiful set of sliding glass doors, opening up the home to natural light and creating seamless indoor-outdoor living.

  This exterior renovation included structural modifications, new framing, and the installation of high-quality sliding glass doors. The result is a modern update that completely changes the home's curb appeal and functionality.

  Perfect for homeowners looking to convert garage space into living areas, home offices, or sunrooms — this project shows how a strategic exterior change can dramatically improve a home's character and value."
