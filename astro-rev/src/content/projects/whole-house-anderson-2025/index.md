description: "What started as a worn-down shell became a complete transformation. We gutted this home down to the studs and rebuilt it inside and out — turning it into a modern 4-bedroom, 4-bath dream home that's perfectly suited for student housing or shared living.

  From a brand-new kitchen with updated cabinetry, appliances, and countertops, to fully redesigned bathrooms, new HVAC, flooring, plumbing, and electrical systems, every inch of this property was re-imagined for comfort, efficiency, and style.

  The finished space feels fresh, open, and durable — ideal for tenants who want modern amenities with low-maintenance living. This project is a great example of how a full rebuild can completely redefine a property's purpose and value."
